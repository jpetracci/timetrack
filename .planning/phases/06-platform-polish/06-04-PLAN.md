<objective>
Complete accessibility integration by adding semantic labels to ProjectCard and ensuring all interactive elements have proper screen reader support and keyboard navigation.

Purpose: Close the accessibility gap where ProjectCard and other components lacked semantic labels and screen reader support despite comprehensive accessibility helpers being available.

Output: Fully accessible interface with consistent semantic labels and keyboard navigation across all components.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add semantic labels to ProjectCard component</name>
  <files>lib/widgets/project_card.dart</files>
  <action>
    Wrap the ProjectCard with proper semantic labels:
    - Import accessibility_helpers.dart if not already imported
    - Add Semantics widget wrapping the entire card content
    - Include proper label describing the project name and elapsed time
    - Add hint for the main tap action (e.g., "Tap to start/stop timer")
    - Add semantic properties for the details button
    - Ensure proper button semantics for both touch and hover variants
    - Include status information (Running/Stopped) in semantic labels
    - Use AccessibilityHelpers patterns for consistency
  </action>
  <verify>Code compiles and ProjectCard maintains all existing functionality</verify>
  <done>ProjectCard has proper semantic labels for screen readers</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Ensure keyboard navigation on web/desktop platforms</name>
  <files>lib/widgets/project_card.dart</files>
  <action>
    Add proper focus management for keyboard navigation:
    - Make ProjectCard focusable with Focus widget
    - Add focus node for the main card action
    - Handle keyboard events (Enter/Space) for card activation
    - Ensure proper focus order within the card
    - Add visual focus indicators that work across platforms
    - Maintain platform-adaptive behavior (touch vs keyboard)
    - Ensure tab navigation works correctly between cards
  </action>
  <verify>Keyboard navigation works without breaking touch interactions</verify>
  <done>Keyboard navigation properly supported on web/desktop platforms</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Verify accessibility compliance in reports and project details screens</name>
  <files>lib/ui/screens/reports_screen.dart, lib/ui/screens/project_details_screen.dart</files>
  <action>
    Review and enhance accessibility in data-heavy screens:
    - Verify all interactive elements use AccessibilityHelpers patterns
    - Add semantic labels for any missing buttons or controls
    - Ensure proper focus management in complex layouts
    - Add keyboard navigation support for filtering/sorting controls
    - Verify data tables have proper headers and structure
    - Ensure loading states are announced to screen readers
    - Add proper semantic grouping for related content
  </action>
  <verify>All interactive elements in both screens have proper accessibility support</verify>
  <done>Reports and project details screens fully compliant with accessibility guidelines</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- ProjectCard provides proper semantic labels for screen readers
- All interactive elements are keyboard navigable on web/desktop
- Reports screen has complete accessibility compliance
- Project details screen has complete accessibility compliance
- AccessibilityHelpers patterns are consistently applied
- Focus management works correctly across all enhanced components
- Screen reader testing (manual) would show proper element announcements
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- ProjectCard component has comprehensive semantic labels
- All interactive elements support keyboard navigation on web/desktop
- Reports screen accessibility compliance verified and enhanced
- Project details screen accessibility compliance verified and enhanced
- Consistent use of AccessibilityHelpers patterns across all components
- Proper focus management and visual focus indicators
- Screen reader can navigate and understand all interface elements
