# Roadmap: TimeTrack

Building a cross-platform time-tracking app from scratch using Flutter, starting with core timer functionality and progressively adding project management, reporting, and platform optimization. The journey begins with a minimal viable timer and expands to a full-featured time tracking solution while maintaining simplicity and local-first privacy.
